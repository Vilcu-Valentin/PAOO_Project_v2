## About
A small **command-line RPG** featuring:
- Simple **quests** that auto-resolve when started  
- **Chests** that drop from successful quests  
- **Items** with attributes *(HP, STR, INT, DEF, DEX, etc.)*  
- **Leveling up** to tackle harder challenges  

The gameplay loop is simple but satisfying — grind quests, open chests, equip items, repeat!
